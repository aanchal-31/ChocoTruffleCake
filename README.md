CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE

I am a HUGE fan of chocolate, especially chocolate cake – there are few things more comforting.
I always have some kind of chocolate around the house.
I’m more of a semi-sweet or dark chocolate fan rather than milk or, heaven forbid, white chocolate. 
No offense to any readers who love white chocolate, it is just not my thing. 
I don’t like the flavor, and rarely have it around unless I need it for a special baking project. 
Let me tell you though, this Chocolate Truffle Cake will satisfy any chocolate lovers craving. 
The cake itself is dense and moist, just like proper chocolate cake should be, and the frosting.
Pure chocolate heaven! It’s simple, consisting of chocolate, heavy cream, and butter, which is basically how you make a chocolate truffle, albeit with slightly different proportions. 
It is dreamy chocolate heaven right there.
